(Yet Another) X-Wing Miniatures Squad Builder
=============================================

What?
-----
This is a squad builder for Fantasy Flight Games' X-Wing Miniatures
game, completely in HTML and JavaScript.  No backend is necessary.
It can theoretically be dropped into any existing site, but since
it uses a lot of styling from [Twitter
Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) it may require
some CSS trickery if you're using some other incompatible framework
(e.g. [Foundation](foundation.zurb.com)).

Can I save squads or share them on `$SOCIAL_NETWORK`?
-----------------------------------------------------
No, but you can use the Permalink button in the top right.

Aren't there other squad builders out there already?
----------------------------------------------------
Yes.

So...?
------
I wanted a project to work on and screw around with stuff like HAML and Bootstrap and Select2, etc.

When will this be done?
-----------------------
It's an ongoing process.

CHANGELOG
=========

30 Dec 2012
-----------
* Overhaul backend to be much less crappy.
* Add full support for Wave 2 ships (from what I can tell from what's been spoiled on [BoardGameGeek](http://boardgamegeek.com/).
* Switch from [Foundation](foundation.zurb.com) to [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).
* Switch from [Chosen](harvesthq.github.com/chosen/) to [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/).
* Now has a printer-friendly mode.
