## YASB 2.0 Bug Report
If your page doesn't load, try a hard refresh first. I update at random hours of the day and you may have been accessing the page at one of those times. 

**Note 1:** When switching between Epic and other formats, the Command upgrades stay on the ships, though no new upgrades are selectable. Please note that in your list building, I am aware and working on a fix for that issue.
