## YASB 2.0 Bug Report
If your page doesn't load, try a hard refresh first. I update at random hours of the day and you may have been accessing the page at one of those times. 

**Note 1:** If you use Microsoft Edge the fonts are messed up. I can't do anything about it, its an issue with the font which is not controlled by me. Also, use Firefox or Chrome instead anyways.
