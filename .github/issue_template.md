## YASB 2.0 Bug Report
If your page doesn't load, try a hard refresh first. I update at random hours of the day and you may have been accessing the page at one of those times. 

**Note 1:** If you use Microsoft Edge the fonts are messed up. I can't do anything about it, its an issue with the font which is not controlled by me. Also, use Firefox or Chrome instead anyways.
**Note 2:** If you can't log in, try updating your browser to the latest version, and if you're not using Chrome or Firefox, try them. There was a change to how cookies are stored and we updated to be in line with that but that breaks compatibility with some older browsers.
